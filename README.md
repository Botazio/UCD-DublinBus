# COMP47360 - Research Practicum

Code for the group project for COMP47360 - Research Practicum

## Project Description

This project contains the code of a web application for Dublin Bus that aims to provide
more accurate travel time estimates than those provided by static timetables. We describe how
we innovate beyond the project specification by also estimating and presenting the uncertainty
around these time estimates in a novel way and by providing extensive user authentication and
customisation options. The uncertainty estimates are based on a Neural Network model but we
find that this model does not outperform simpler benchmark models on average, although there is
significant variation in model accuracy across the bus network. Our survey results also show that
while users often prefer time ranges to single point estimates, they struggle to interpret and find
value in more complex uncertainty visualisations.

The report details the application, development
and testing process and results, major contributions of each team member, weaknesses of the
application, and future work.
